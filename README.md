# games

Terminal implementations of some games using Python. So far I have Tic-Tac-Toe and Reversi.
In the future I hope to build an abstract class framework from which specific game
implementations (subclasses) are derived. This would make it easier to test out different
AI game-playing algorithms, which would probably be a project for another repo entirely.
